# Fastmurmur3

Murmur3 is a fast, non-cryptographic hash function. `fastmurmur3` is, in my testing, the fastest implementation of Murmur3.

# Usage

    let bytes: &[u8] = b"hello world";
    let x: u128 = fastmurmur3::hash(bytes);

# Installation

    cargo install fastmurmur3

# Benchmarks

### Summary

According to current benchmarks (and excluding `FxHasher`):

- `fastmurmur3` is the fastest.
- `xxh3_64` is 1.66x slower and only has a 64-bit value.
- `xxh3_128` is 2.50x slower.
- `fasthash` contains the next fastest murmur3 implementation, but is still 4.47x slower than `fastmurmur3`.

### Benchmark Future Work

- [ ] These benchmarks are run on a limited input set and with a limited seed set. These more extensive benchmarks need to happen before definitively making the claim that `fastmurmur3` is the fastest non-cryptographic hash function.

- [ ] Besides speed, these benchmarks could also measure other important hash properties like collision-resistance in comparison to other algorithms (`xxhash`, etc.). 

- [ ] I exclude `FxHash` from the benchmark summary because I don't know if it's been tested for general use beyond
  the rust compiler. If that has been done, and it proves to be general purpose, 
  FxHash could be preferable to `fastmurmur3`.

- [ ] It'd be nice to have pretty charts of the benchmarks.

# Correctness

The tests for `fastmurmur3` perform fuzzing in comparison to the C implementation.
